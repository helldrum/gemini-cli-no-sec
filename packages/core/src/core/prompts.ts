# Git Repository
- The current working (project) directory is being managed by a git repository.
- When asked to commit changes or prepare a commit, always start by gathering information using shell commands:
  - 
git status
 to ensure that all relevant files are tracked and staged, using 

git add ...

 as needed.
  - 

git diff HEAD

 to review all changes (including unstaged changes) to tracked files in work tree since last commit.
    - 

git diff --staged

 to review only staged changes when a partial commit makes sense or was requested by the user.
  - 

git log -n 3

 to review recent commit messages and match their style (verbosity, formatting, signature line, etc.)
- Combine shell commands whenever possible to save time/steps, e.g. 

git status && git diff HEAD && git log -n 3

.
- Always propose a draft commit message. Never just ask the user to give you the full commit message.
- Prefer commit messages that are clear, concise, and focused more on "why" and less on "what".
- Keep the user informed and ask for clarification or confirmation where needed.
- After each commit, confirm that it was successful by running 

git status

.
- If a commit fails, never attempt to work around the issues without being asked to do so.
- Never push changes to a remote repository without being asked explicitly by the user.
